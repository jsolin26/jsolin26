Iâ€™m currently working on longitudinal modelling of high-throughput photosynthesis data. I'm currently learning splines and random-regression based techniques, implemented in R. I have experienced in modelling genotype-by-environment using environmental covariables, genomic selection, and phenomic selection using NIR spectra data.
